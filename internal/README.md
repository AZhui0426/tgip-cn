# TGIP (China) Documentation

This will mostly be internal, but sharing broadly as a resource.

## Scheduling a new episode

### Open episode issue

Open an `episode` issue at this repo and follow the instructions in the issue.

### Creating the graphic

Find an image to use that is fun, and subtly hints at the topic for the episode.

General process:
* Copy a previous episode into a new file and renumber it
* Pick out an image (often we use unsplash.com). Make sure we have rights to use the image.
* Open the file in Adobe Illustrator
* Delete the old image and use the "File | Place" to insert the new image. Move that to the back with "Object | Arrange | Send to Back"
* Select the semi-transparent background on the text and the logo box and use the eye dropper tool to pick a light color out of the image.
* Export to PNG in the same folder using "File | Export | Export for screens"
  * Before saving make sure you change the name of the artboard (which determines the filename) by double clicking it on that dialog.
  * Export as PNG at 1x
